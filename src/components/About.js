    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm an American full stack web developer living in Tokyo.
    I enrolled in Le Wagon Tokyo's coding bootcamp because I love to create new
    things. I specialize in Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React, but I am
    also interested in UX/UI design and always look for new things to learn. I am
    especially interested in e-Commerce. I am open
    to opportunities, so feel free to contact me!</p>
